          SRI KALABAIRAVAR TEMPLE is most famous temple in Virudhunagar District
          Surrounding areas In India, Virudhunagar V.Nangoor Kalabairavar temple
          comes under Tamilnadu Hindu Religion Department..Kalabhairava is a
          Hindu deity, often associated with fierce aspects of Lord Shiva.
          Kalabhairava is considered the guardian deity of Kashi (Varanasi), and
          he is believed to be the one who presides over the city. The name
          "Kalabhairava" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Kala," meaning
          time, and "Bhairava," referring to a fierce form of Lord Shivan.
          According to the legend, there was once a dispute between Brahma, the
          creator of the universe, and Vishnu, the preserver. The two gods were
          arguing about their superiority, each claiming to be the supreme
          deity. The disagreement became intense, and as a result, a fiery and
          fearsome being emerged from the forehead of Brahma. This fierce being
          came to be known as Kalabhairava. Kalabhairava, now a manifestation of
          Shiva's anger, took the form of a terrifying black dog.

          <img
            style="border-radius: 2%; filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 2px #000000)"
            class="float-end mt-2 ms-3 col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-12"
            src="image/tem3.JPG"
            width="200px"
            alt=""
          />
          In this form, he chased Brahma to teach him a lesson. Kalabhairava, in
          the form of the black dog, chased Brahma wherever he went. Realizing
          the gravity of the situation and the divine nature of Kalabhairava,
          Brahma sought forgiveness and asked for a way to atone for his
          actions. Kalabhairava, in his fierce form, forgave Brahma but cursed
          him for his arrogance. The curse was that Brahma would lose his
          importance in the worship rituals. It is believed that this curse is
          the reason why there are very few temples dedicated to Brahma, and he
          is not as widely worshipped as other deities in Hinduism. As a result
          of the curse, Brahma realized his mistake and sought redemption. He
          began to perform penance at the sacred city of Kashi (Varanasi). To
          seek forgiveness from Kalabhairava, Brahma installed a Shiva Lingam at
          Kashi and performed intense prayers. Pleased with Brahma's penance,
          Kalabhairava forgave him and granted him salvation. Since then,
          Kalabhairava has been worshipped as the guardian deity of Kashi, and
          it is believed that he protects the city and its residents. Devotees
          also seek his blessings for the effective management of time and the
          removal of obstacles. This legend emphasizes the importance of
          humility and the consequences of arrogance, even among the divine
          beings. It also highlights the significance of Kalabhairava as a
          powerful and fierce form of Lord Shiva, associated with the control of
          time and the dispensation of justice.

          <h3>Legend behind Kala Bhairava</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Many interesting legends abound on Kala Bhairava. A tale in the Shiv
            Mahapurana talks about his origin. Once, Lord Brahma told Lord
            Vishnu to worship him, as he created the universe. This infuriated
            Lord Shiva, who took the form of Kala Bhairava to punish him. He
            chopped off one of Brahma's five heads. Thus Brahma now has only
            four heads while Bhairava the fifth is carried by Shiva. But by
            chopping off Brahma's head, Shiva became guilty of killing a
            Brahman. For this reason, Bhairava had to carry the head around with
            him for 12 years. He roamed about like a vagabond, until he was
            freed of the sin. The idol of Bhairava is often seen in this
            frightening form. The word 'Bhairava' itself has deep meaning.
            'Bhai' denotes fear as well as lustrous light. It can give one
            material wealth. 'Rava' denotes echo. While 'Ra' eliminates
            negativity and stifled consciousness, 'Va' creates opportunities. To
            sum up, Bhairava means that we can achieve 'aseem anand' or great
            delight by using fear.

          <h3>Benefits of Worshipping Kala Bhairava</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Bhairava is revered by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. He helps them to
            achieve success, conquer enemies and attain material comforts. He
            also helps them to use their time constructively in attaining their
            goals. This is why he is known as the Lord of Time. Those who waste
            time in trivial pursuits can become more efficient and productive if
            they worship Kala Bhairava regularly. He makes our souls pure
            through his power and brings luck to believers. As if by miracle,
            one finds oneself at the right place at the right time to avail the
            best opportunities.Another name for Lord Bhairava is 'Kotwal' or
            'Kshetrapalaka', meaning 'guardian of the temple'. Hence, the keys
            to the temples of Shiva and Shakti are ceremonially given to
            Bhairava at closing time and taken back from him in the morning.
            Usually, there is a shrine dedicated to him in such temples. He is
            also the guardian deity of travellers and blesses pilgrims.
            According to the Siddhas, before going on a journey, especially
            during night travel, one should light lamps and put a garland of
            cashew nut wreaths on Lord Bhairava. This ensures their safety and
            protection. For those who live abroad too, the worship is equally
            significant. Though he is one of the most feared gods, he is also
            one of the most rewarding and protective deities. In Tantrism, he is
            revered as Batuk Bharav. As he is a Rudra, the Lord is an expert in
            tantra-mantra. Kala Bhairava's vehicle is the dog which is usually
            seated on one side, eager to taste the blood dripping from the
            chopped head of Lord Brahma. Hence, one way to honor him is by
            taking care of and feeding dogs. Kala Bhairava is known to bestow
            great blessings and the boon of auspicious time to those who worship
            him. There is a myth that if one feeds 'halwa puri' (sweet bread) to
            hungry dogs, all problems will vanish automatically.

          <h3>Worship of Kala Bhairava</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Kala Bhairava has been worshipped from time immemorial. But sacred
            texts claim that the 60 years from April 2002 to April 2062,
            constitute the most important period. The 8th day (Ashtami) after
            the Full Moon (Poornima) is the best day for pooja. Devotees
            celebrate Kala Bhairava Jayanthi on the day he appeared on earth in
            Margashirsha (November-December) month. The 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva
            shrines in Ujjain, Kasi, Tiruvannamalai and others perform many
            special ceremonies on this day. There are 8 forms of Kala Bhairava -
            Chanda Bhairava, Asithaanga Bhairava, Krodha Bhairava, Ruru
            Bhairava, Unmattha Bhairava, Bheeshana Bhairava, Kapaala Bhairava
            and Samhaara Bhairava. As he guards the 52 Shaktipeethas, it is
            believed that there are 52 forms of Bhairava across the holy sites.
            It is necessary to protect Shakti for everlasting peace in the midst
            of increasing wrath, hatred and violence. Praying to Lord Kala
            Bhairava and Sarabeswara and Amruta Mrityunjaya is necessary for
            this.Kala Bhairava is worshipped by the Aghoris, the Kapalika sect,
            Gorat Kashmiris, Assamese tantric practitioners, the Gowdas of
            Karnataka, people in Kathmandu and Sri Lanka and many other
            communities. The Bhairava in Kashi is greatly revered. In rural
            areas of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, etc., he is regarded as the
            village protector. Decorative statues of 'grama devata' adorn most
            village entrances.
